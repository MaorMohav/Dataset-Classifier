# Dataset-Classifier
Dataset Classifier - Data Mining course final project.


# About The Project

Wonder what scores of precision can you achieve with different angles of data classification? So in this project I managed to create semi-automat classifier of dataset (Numeric/Categorial) data.

The project contains a dictionary that will save the values that will run the model using functions we have written (The values will be received as input from the user in the GUI).

This classifier includes:

-   Naive Bayes

-   Decision Tree

-   K-Nearest Neighbors

-   K-Means
