# Dataset-Classifier
Dataset Classifier - Data Mining course final project.


# About The Project
Wonder what scores of precision can you achieve with different angles of data classification? So in this project I managed to create semi-automat classifier of dataset (Numeric/Categorial) data.

This classifier includes:

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors

K-Means
